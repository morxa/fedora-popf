%description
POPF is forwards-chaining temporal planner. Its name derives from the fact that
it incorporates ideas from partial-order planning â€” during search, when
applying an action to a state, it seeks to introduce only the ordering
constraints needed to resolve threats, rather than insisting the new action
occurs after all of those already in the plan. Its implementation is built on
that for the planner COLIN, and it retains the ability to handle domains with
linear continuous numeric effects.
